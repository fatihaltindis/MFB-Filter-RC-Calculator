# MFB-Filter-RC-Calculator
MFB topology is used for active filtering. Here, there are two functions, one is for high-pass MFB filter and the other one is for low-pass MFB filter. These functions take filter parameters (Q_factor, cut-off frequency, gain and available capacitor and resistor values) as input. It estimates all the possible R/C combinations that satisfies given filter parameters and returns them as a table.

## Available Capacitor values
In default, all of the factory size capacitor values below 5 micro Farad are included as capactior library. 

## Available Resistor values
In default, all of the factory size resistor values below 10 Mega Ohm are included as resistor library.

## Transfer function for High-Pass MFB Filter
will be added soon

## Transfer function for Low-Pass MFB Filter
will be added soon
